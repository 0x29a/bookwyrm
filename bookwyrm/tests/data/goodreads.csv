One recipe calls for 1/32 oz, which I have absolutely no way of measuring out<br/> - Some of the measurements were baffling, like 1/3 tablespoon. 1/3 tablespoon is 1 teaspoon, why would you write 1/3 tablespoon??<br/> - The croissant dough recipe said to allow the pastry to get to room temperature before rolling which meant the butter squirted out and made a huge mess. I don't know why it said to do this??? Rolling works just fine if it's chilled.<br/> - The financier recipe just tells you to add egg whites and has no other raising agent so if you just add the egg whites it will obviously not rise. Either there should have been a raising agent or the egg whites should have been beaten? I don't know.",,,2,,,0,,,,,
